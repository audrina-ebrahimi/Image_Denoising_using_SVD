# Image_Denoising_using_SVD

---

This repository includes code and resources for applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce noise in images. Image denoising is an essential task in image processing, which aims to eliminate or minimize noise while preserving vital details. SVD is a potent mathematical technique that can be employed to reduce dimensionality and noise in images.
